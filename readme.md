![Map scheme](img/demo.gif)

Implementation of distributed multi-agent navigation algorithm based on combination of reciprocal 
collision avoidance and individual path planner. There is an option that activate deadlock avoidance by locally 
confined multi-agent path finding (MAPF) solvers, that coordinate sub-groups of the agents that appear to be in a deadlock.

## Description

### Decentrilized Navigation
The algorithm is based on the idea of planning a global path for all agents independently 
and moving along this path with local collision avoidance. 
Theta* algorithm are using to global path planning and ORCA algorithm are using for 
local collision avoidance with agents and static obstacles. 
Also direct moving to goal without global planning is available.

**Theta*** is a version of A* algorithm for any-angle path planning on grids. 
Theta* mostly the same as A*, but, unlike A*, 
Theta* allows parent of current vertex may be any other vertex, 
which are visible from current [[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.3843.pdf)].

The **ORCA** algorithm is a decentralized collision avoidance algorithm in a 
multi-agent environment. The main idea of the algorithm is iterative selection 
of new agent speed, close to a certain preferred velocity. Selection of 
the new speed is based on ORCA principle. 
**Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA)** — the principle, 
which provides a sufficient condition for multiple robots to avoid 
collisions among one another, and thus can guarantee collision-free 
navigation [[2](http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/ORCA/publications/ORCA.pdf)]. 
The principle is based on the concept of velocity obstacles, which are 
used to search for a new  speed of agent so that during the time **_t_** there 
is no collision with other agents. In the process of searching for a new velocity, 
algorithm creates a set of n-1 linear constraints(where n is the number of agents 
that the current one takes into account). A new velocity (Vnew) that satisfies these 
constraints and is close to the preferred velocity, are searched using an linear programming. 
The preferred velocity is selected so that the agent makes a move to the target point. 
More information about ORCA algorithm you can find at 
ORCA creators web page [[3](http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/ORCA/)].


The agent is a disk of radius _r_ centered at _p_ with their start and 
global goal positions. For each neighboring agent (located at a distance _R_ or less), 
their position and current speed are known. At the beginning of task execution every 
agent tries to find a path to their global goal, using Theta* algorithm. 
After getting of global path (which is a sequence of points in space, where the 
first point is the global goal), agent begin moving. First target point is the 
last element in path sequence. At each simulation step, for each agent, a new 
velocity _Vnew_ are searched, using ORCA algorithm. 
After that global simulation time is changed to _dt_, the position of all agents 
is changed to _dt_ * _Vnew_ (own for each agent) and every agent compute new target point. 
If the agent has reached the last point in the sequence, then the next point in the 
sequence becomes the target, and the previous one is deleted. Otherwise, a 
visibility check is made between the agent’s position and the last point. If 
visibility is confirmed, then the last becomes the target point, otherwise the path 
from the agent's position to the last point is searched. 
High-level pseudocode of the suggested method is presented below

### Deadlock Avoidance
In numerous scenarios, involving navigation through the tight passages or  confined spaces, deadlocks are likely to occur due to the egoistic behaviour  of the agents and as a result, the latter can not achieve their goal. To reach the goals the agents may to exhibit a form of coordination and some of them could to yield to the others.

![deadlock_avoidance_example](img/deadlock_avoidance_example.png)

So, it each time step, an agent gathers the information about the states of the agents that are within the 
communication/visibility  range (neighbours). This data is used not only to choose the velocity but also to detect deadlocks. 
If a deadlock is detected (Picture (a) on figure above) an agent initiates switching to the MAPF mode.  
As a result, certain  agents  enter  this  mode.  These  agents share  the  information  about  their  states  and  
current  goals (waypoints  on  the  geometric  paths  that  they  want  to  reach) so  each  of  them  possess  the 
same  local  world  model.  The latter is used to create a MAPF (Multi-Agent Pathfinding) instance and solve it (Picture (b) on figure above).  
We  emphasize  that  each  agent  operates  individually in  the MAPF  mode and  no central controller  is  introduced. 
However  as  the  operations  in  this  mode  are deterministic and  each  agent  knows  the  states  and  goals  of  other agents, 
the result of forming a MAPF instance and solving it is the same  across  all  involved  agents.  
In our works we suggest using Push and Rotate [[4](https://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2013/docs/p87.pdf)] and 
ECBS [[5](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/SOCS/article/download/18315/18106)] algorithms. 
Consequently,  each agent obtains  the  same  MAPF  solution  –  a  set  of  collision-free plans (Picture (c) on figure above). 
It then  extracts  its  individual  plan  from  this  solution and follows it to resolve the deadlock. 
After all agents finish execution  of  their  MAPF  plans  they  switch  back  to  normal mode, i.e.  
continue  moving  to  the  next  waypoint  on  their geometric path utilizing collision avoidance (Picture (d) on figure above).
High-level  pseudocode  of  the  suggested  method  is  presented below

## Running the Implementation
Code is written in C++ and is meant to be cross-platform. 
Implementation relies only on C++14 standard and STL. 

Open-source library to work with XML (tinyXML2) is included as git submodule
(in `external` subdirectory).

Original implementation of MAPF algorithms you can find in GitHub repository [[6](https://github.com/PathPlanning/Push-and-Rotate--CBS--PrioritizedPlanning)]

To build and run the project you can use CMake, `CMakeLists.txt` file is available in the repo. 
Please note that the code relies on C++14 standard. Make sure that your compiler supports it. 
At the moment, the build and launch were tested only on Manjaro Linux using the GCC 13.1 C++ compiler.

### Download

Download current repository to your local machine. Use:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:PathPlanning/ORCA-algorithm.git
```

There are several options to build this project. Use the following commands to build:

#### Build

**_Linux_**
```bash
cd ORCA-algorithm
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE={Release/Debug} -DFULL_OUTPUT_FLAG={ON/OFF} -DFULL_LOG_FLAG={ON/OFF} -DMAPF_LOG_FLAG={ON/OFF} ..
make
```

where optins:
- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` — Standard CMake option that specifies the build type. For more information see [[CMake Documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html)]    
etc
  - `Release` uses to build with no debugging information. 
  - `Debug` usually uses to enable debugging information, disable optimization 
- `FULL_OUTPUT_FLAG` — Enables/disables full output to stdout about reading xml files.
- `FULL_LOG_FLAG` — Enables/disables logging to xml file agents state information
- `MAPF_LOG_FLAG` — Enables/disables logging to xml files information about MAPF instances in coordinated mode

## Launch
There are two options to test the algorithm: single test on one task and series of tasks.
Use the following command to launch single test:

```bash
./single_test {file_name num}
```
where 
- `file_name` — name of the XML file, which contain task;
- `num` — the number of agents with which tasks will run.

For example:
```bash
./single_test ../task_examples/empty_task.xml 10
```
  
Summary will be displayed after execution using standard output, full log (if such option in in CMake was chosen) 
will be saved in same directory as task file and will be named according to the following pattern:
```
*taskfilename*_*number_of_agents*_log.xml
```
For example:
```
empty_task_10_log.xml
```


Use the following command to launch series test:
```bash
./series_test {n_min n_step n_max n_tasks path}
```
where 
- `n_min` — the initial number of agents at which tasks will run;
- `n_step` — step of changing the number of agents when restarting tasks;
- `n_max` — the final number of agents at which tasks will run;
- `n_tasks` — the number of tasks in series;
- `path` — path to the folder, which contains task files; 

For example:
```bash
./series_test 5 5 10 2 ../task_examples
```

To run the series tests and get a result you need to pass a correct input XML-file(s). The task files must be named according to the following pattern:
```
*number*_task.xml
```
Moreover, the numbering of tasks should form a sequence of numbers from **_0_** to **_n_tasks-1_**.
For example:
```
0_task.xml
1_task.xml
```

If the number of agents in the task is less than the required value, it will be started with the number of agents specified in the task.

Summary will be written after execution of each task in file `path/result.txt`, full log (if such option was chosen) will be saved at _path_ and will be named according to the following pattern:
```
*taskfilename*_*numberofagents*_log.xml
```
For example:
```
0_task_15_log.xml
```
